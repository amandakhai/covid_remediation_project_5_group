|  1 | Color Thresholds:                                                                                                                                    | Thresholds for colors are noted on the "Color Thresholds" tab. The green-to-red color thresholds convey information on levels of transmission severity. There are not specific labels associated with each color threshold. Color thresholds were set based on a variety of factors and analyses, including assessing historical correlations in test positivity and case counts. Colors are determined by first rounding a raw number to the nearest integer or tenth, and then selecting the associated color. If there is no data or a metric cannot be computed, a cell is colored gray. A dash (-) in a cell indicates a value of 0. A blank cell indicates no valid data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Most states and localities report both confirmed and suspected cases and deaths, although some report just confirmed cases and deaths. To ensure data quality, daily data alerts are monitored for deviations in the data (e.g., decreases in cumulative values, no change in values, abnormal increases in values). These alerts are manually reviewed every day by checking the data against local government websites, state websites, and news sources, and the raw values are corrected as needed to reflect local government reports. Cases are based on date of report and not on date of symptom onset. This may cause artificial spikes in any given day of data. Changes in reporting may also cause temporary spikes or dips (e.g. shifts from reporting confirmed and probable cases to reporting just confirmed cases).

| 18 | Number of days of downward case trajectory:                                                                                                          | This field is calculated using a CDC algorithm that first fits a smooth spline curve to daily case counts, and then counts the number of days that curve has been decreasing or at a low level. More specifically, the computation is based on a cubic spline fit of the 7-day rolling average of cases. The number of days decreasing (in downward trajectory) is calculated by summing the number of consecutive days of decline or near-zero incidence. A day is considered part of a downward trajectory if it (i) was previously at elevated incidence (had a two-week incidence greater than 10 cases per 100k population), and (ii) meets one of the following three conditions: (a) had a negative slope, OR (b) was in a low-incidence plateau (two-week incidence ≤ 10 cases per 100k population and a slope ≥ 0 to < 0.1 new cases per 100k population based on a 7-day moving average), OR (c) had less than 5 cases in the past 2 weeks. Normally this metric will either increment by 1 or reset to 0 each day; however, because it is recalculated each day and historical data are sometimes revised, it may fluctuate in other ways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Total number of new cases per 100,000 persons within the last 7 days and 2. Percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) during the last 7 days). If the two indicators suggest different transmission levels, the higher level is selected. Transmission categories include (i) Blue (Low Transmission): control is achieved largely through individual prevention behaviors and the public health response to identify and isolate cases or clusters; counties with fewer than 10 cumulative cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, and a cumulative NAAT percent test positivity result below 5% in the past 7 days, (ii) Yellow (Moderate Transmission): adherence to individual and selected community level prevention strategies are needed; counties with 10–49 cumulative cases per 100,000 population or a cumulative NAAT test positivity result between 5.0–7.9% in the past 7 days, (iii) Orange (Substantial Transmission): everyday activities should be limited to reduce spread and protect the health care system; counties with 50–99 cumulative cases per 100,000 population or a cumulative NAAT test positivity result between 8.0–9.9% in the past 7 days; (iv) Red (High Transmission): significant measures are needed to limit contact between persons, with priority given to maintaining essential community activities and services (e.g., health care, transportation, food and agriculture, schools); counties with cumulative cases 100+ per 100,000 population or a cumulative NAAT test positivity result 10%+ in the past 7 days. |

For territories, percentage of population 65+ is approximated using the national average (17%). Texas provides aggregate dose count data to CDC, limiting the ability to directly calculate age-based metrics. For this reason, Texas value is estimated based on reported totals, using Texas vaccination dashboard to infer the percentage of 65+ population receiving at least one dose and fully vaccinated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The color assigned to each reflects a classification scheme based on that value where probabilities ≥0.75 are classified as increase or decrease and the rest of the values are classified as uncertain. Note: if observed data are outside week 1 of the 50% prediction interval, they are reclassified as uncertain (yellow), as they may reflect reporting anomalies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
